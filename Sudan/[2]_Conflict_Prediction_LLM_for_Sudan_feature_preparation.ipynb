Now it\\u2019s a secret Chinese police station with \\u201csinister\\u201d intentions. On Monday, the FBI unveiled three cases targeting alleged Chinese spy and intimidation efforts in the United States. The first involves the arrest of two men accused of operating an \\u201cillegal overseas police station\\u201d in Manhattan\\u2019s Chinatown on behalf of the Chinese government. Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, both U.S. citizens, were charged with using the facility to track and intimidate Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States. (The station itself, part of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, closed last fall after individuals working there learned of the FBI\\u2019s investigation of the premises.)\\n\\nThe second case accuses 34 Chinese national police officers of working to silence dissidents in the United States. All 34 individuals are believed to be currently living in China, and none of them have been apprehended yet. According to the U.S. Justice Department, the accused are part of the 912 Special Project Working Group, which aims to positively influence public perception of China by having members pose as Americans on social media and post pro-Chinese Communist Party information. A few of the individuals were also accused of issuing death threats against Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States.\\n\\nFinally, the third case builds on a December 2020 criminal complaint alleging that a China-based Zoom employee worked with the Ministry of Public Security to spy on Zoom meetings on topics China considers sensitive, including meetings commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\\n\\nBeijing has rejected the Justice Department\\u2019s claims, calling the FBI\\u2019s investigation \\u201cpolitical manipulation\\u201d and a \\u201cslander and smear campaign.\\u201d These arrests and unsealed cases are just the latest in a series of federal prosecutions focused on stopping Chinese intimidation tactics in recent years. \\u201cThis is a blatant violation of our national sovereignty,\\u201d said Michael Driscoll, who leads the FBI\\u2019s New York field office.\\n\\nHowever, China has been waging a spy war for decades, one Washington failed to recognize before it was too late, historian Calder Walton argues in Foreign Policy. And arrests like these may not be enough to stem the tide. \\u201cRelax,\\u201d Walton writes, \\u201cit\\u2019s much worse than you think.\\u201d\\n\\nToday\\u2019s Most Read\\n\\n\\u2022 The West Is Preparing for Russia\\u2019s Disintegration by Anchal Vohra\\n\\n\\u2022 Macron Said Out Loud What Europeans Really Think About China by Benjamin Haddad\\n\\n\\u2022 What if Kemal Kilicdaroglu Wins Turkey\\u2019s Election? by Steven A. Cook\\n\\nWhat We\\u2019re Following\\n\\nKhartoum cease-fire. Sudanese civilians are hoping for a brief moment of respite. On Tuesday, the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces agreed to a 24-hour cease-fire after four days of heavy fighting and more than 180 deaths. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Gens. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemeti) separately to negotiate the reprieve. Millions of people in the capital have been left hiding in their homes while artillery and airstrikes target residential neighborhoods.\\n\\nCivilians aren\\u2019t the only ones caught in the crossfire. Fighters reportedly attacked a U.S. Embassy convoy as well as assaulted the European Union\\u2019s ambassador to Sudan in his home on Monday. It\\u2019s unclear as of now which side was responsible for these attacks.\\n\\nSurprise visitor. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited occupied Ukrainian territory this weekend to hear reports from military commanders. Video of a speech he gave indicates he traveled to the Kherson and Luhansk regions sometime before Orthodox Easter, although the exact date is still unclear. This trip into Ukraine, though rare, is not Putin\\u2019s first. Last month, the Russian leader traveled to Mariupol in a surprise visit. The coastal city was a key battleground and home to a Russian theater bombing that killed at least 300 civilians in March 2022.\\n\\nSaied cracks down. Tunisian officials arrested four opposition leaders on Monday\\u2014including Rached Ghannouchi, the head of the Ennahdha party, a democratic Islamist movement that once dominated Tunisia\\u2019s parliament. Although Tunisia began transitioning to democracy following the 2011 revolution that saw the toppling of longtime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the current president, Kais Saied, has systematically undermined the North African country\\u2019s fledgling democratic institutions since his election in 2019. Saied has a long history of targeting political dissidents as the nation\\u2019s economy has ticked toward implosion.\\n\\nChart of the Week\\n\\nWith Beijing\\u2019s increasingly assertive military actions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, many U.S. government officials and Indo-Pacific experts worry of an impending Chinese invasion of the island. This includes CIA director William Burns, who predicted that China would invade Taiwan by 2027. But not everyone is so convinced. More than 72 percent of international relations scholars at U.S. colleges and universities polled by William & Mary\\u2019s Teaching, Research, and International Policy project do not believe China will use military force against Taiwan in the next year. To dive deeper into what the likelihood of a war over Taiwan is, check out what the experts have to say.\\n\\nOdds and Ends\\n\\nImagine losing an art contest to a robot. For contestants in the creative open category of the 2023 Sony World Photography Awards, they don\\u2019t need to imagine it.

Eldagsen wrote on his personal website that he \\u201capplied as a cheeky monkey\\u201d to see \\u201cif the competitions are prepared for AI images to enter.

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir urged Sudanese holdout groups Sunday to join the negotiation table to fast-track the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke after leaders from South Sudan and Sudan witnessed the signing of the third amendment of an implementation matrix of the agreement between Sudan's government and opposition groups under the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF).\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Kiir, who is the guarantor of the Sudan peace agreement, said the signed implementation matrix will fast-track the formation of the transitional government of national unity in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"I would like to once again call upon General Abdelaziz Adam El Hilu, the leader of the SPLM-North, and Ustaz Abdul Wahid Mohamed al Nur, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, to seriously consider joining the Juba Peace Agreement,\\\" said Kiir, according to a press statement posted on his official Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stressed that lasting peace in Sudan will remain elusive until these leaders join the peace train.\\n\\n\\n\\nKiir said that peace is an important dividend for the two sisterly countries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As a guarantor, our shared historical values and common interests demand that we work for stability to ensure prosperity for our people. It is our desire for peace in Sudan that compelled us to host numerous rounds of negotiations between the transitional government and various oppositions groups,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said the new roadmap is not an attempt at renegotiating the 2020 Juba peace agreement signed to end decades of conflict but rather to facilitate dialogue among parties to transition the country toward a sustainable peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As the guarantor who led the process, let me reiterate on behalf of other guarantors that this workshop is not a parallel political process or a renegotiation of the Juba Peace Agreement. It is intended to contribute to the ongoing dialogue in Sudan about options for the transition and best approach towards the issue of democratic transformation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opposition parties that signed the matrix include the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) faction led by Malik Agar, the Justice and Equality Movement under Gibril Ibrahim, the Democratic Union party led by Eltom Hajou and the Sudan Liberation Movement under Minni Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe holdout groups such as the SPLM-N faction led by Abdel Aziz Al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement under Abdul Wahi Al-Nur did not sign the matrix.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan's Sovereign Council, said his government remains committed to realizing security, freedom and development in all regions of Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"The implementation of the Juba peace agreement will help in putting into practice the 2012 cooperation agreement, providing joint border security and the opening of border points for trade and exchange,\\\" said Al-Burhan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe reaffirmed his government's commitment to work with the signatories to the Juba peace deal to fully implement the matrix for lasting peace in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinnawi called on the international community and the region to avail financial and political support for the implementation of the peace deal, which has stalled due to a lack of funding and political uncertainty in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"We need political and financial support including regional and international support to bring changes and fully implement all pending tasks. In Darfur, we call for peace and development, and we hope the Juba Peace Agreement will allow refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their original homes,\\\" said Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsmail Wais, the special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), urged the signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement to consistently implement it, noting that the peace guarantors are behind the government of Sudan to ensure that a sustainable peace is reached in the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nEl Sheikh Iben Omar, the special advisor of Chad's President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, commended the government of South Sudan for the support and mediation of the Sudanese peace agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Juba Peace Agreement was signed in Juba under the auspices of President Kiir on Oct. 3, 2020 between the Sudanese government and 14 signatories.

            "\n",
            "Doctors say hundreds are injured, while the World Health Organization warned \"several of the nine hospitals in Khartoum receiving injured civilians have run out of blood, transfusion equipment, intravenous fluids and other vital supplies\".\n",

            "The battles between the powerful armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) sparked an international outcry and regional concern, including border closures by neighbours Egypt and Chad.\n",
            "\n",
            "Deafening explosions and intense gunfire rattled buildings in the capital Khartoum's densely populated northern and southern suburbs as tanks rumbled on the streets and fighter jets roared overhead, witnesses said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fighting continued after nightfall on Sunday, as Sudanese hunkered down in their homes with fears of a prolonged conflict that could plunge the country into deeper chaos, dashing long-held hopes for a transition to civilian-led democracy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Violence erupted early Saturday following weeks of power struggles between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo who heads the heavily armed RSF.\n",

            "The pro-democracy Central Committee of Sudan Doctors reported 56 civilians killed as well as \"tens of deaths\" among security forces, and around 600 wounded.\n",

            "Late Sunday afternoon the army said they had \"agreed to a United Nations proposal to open safe passage for humanitarian cases\", including the evacuation of wounded, for three hours, which ended at 1700 GMT.\n",
            "\n",
            "RSF confirmed the measure, though they said it would last four hours, and both sides maintained their right to \"respond in the event of transgressions\" from the other side.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the pause, heavy gunfire could be heard in central Khartoum near the airport, and dense black smoke billowed from the surrounding area.\n",

            "As the fighting continued, the stench of gunpowder wafted through Khartoum's streets, deserted except for soldiers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Medics pleaded for safe corridors for ambulances and a ceasefire to treat the victims because the streets were too dangerous for transporting casualties to hospital.\n",

            "The UN said its WFP employees had been killed Saturday in clashes in North Darfur and announced a \"temporary halt to all operations in Sudan\".\n",
            "\n",
            "After their deaths as well as those of other civilians, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for \"justice without delay\". He had earlier warned that an escalation in the fighting would \"further aggravate the already precarious humanitarian situation\".\n",

The casualties are likely to rise in the clashes that took place near the capital of Khartoum. Meanwhile, Fedail Hospital in central Khartoum has received dozens of wounded civilians and military personnel in the last several hours, reported CNN citing sources. Some of those injured are in critical condition. In a statement earlier, the Sudanese Doctors' Trade Union reported at least three civilian deaths, with two being killed at Khartoum International Airport, according to the union's report, which was released on Saturday, as per CNN. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres has condemned the outbreak of fighting between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces in Sudan. \"The Secretary-General calls on the leaders of the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces to immediately cease hostilities, restore calm and initiate a dialogue to resolve the current crisis. Any further escalation in the fighting will have a devastating impact on civilians and further aggravate the already precarious humanitarian situation in the country,\" the spokesperson for the Secretary-General said. The Indian embassy has also made an appeal to the Indians to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan. In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, \"Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates.\" The embassy's warning came in light of clashes between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. Clashes were reported between rival factions of armed forces in Sudan, and several gunshots and explosions were witnessed on Saturday morning in various parts of Khartoum, reported New York Times. As the clashes escalated, later in the day, the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have gained control of the Presidential Palace. Many videos were circulated on social media showing armed fighters driving across the runway of the city's international airport, in which heavy gunshots were audible. The Sudanese military, after 18 months of its coup, had promised to cede control to a civilian-led government this month. Yet, the process has been dominated by a rivalry between General al-Burhan and General Hamdan, also known as Hemeti. (ANI)\n",

            "2023-04-15 In a clash between a paramilitary group with the Sudanese army on Saturday, 25 people lost their lives whereas 183 were severely injured, CNN reported citing the Sudanese Central Medical Committee. The casualties are likely to rise in the clashes that took place near the capital of Khartoum. Meanwhile, Fedail Hospital in central Khartoum has received dozens of wounded civilians and military personnel in the last several hours, reported CNN citing sources. Some of those injured are in critical condition. In a statement earlier, the Sudanese Doctors' Trade Union reported at least three civilian deaths, with two being killed at Khartoum International Airport, according to the union's report, which was released on Saturday, as per CNN. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres has condemned the outbreak of fighting between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces in Sudan. \"The Secretary-General calls on the leaders of the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces to immediately cease hostilities, restore calm and initiate a dialogue to resolve the current crisis. Any further escalation in the fighting will have a devastating impact on civilians and further aggravate the already precarious humanitarian situation in the country,\" the spokesperson for the Secretary-General said. The Indian embassy has also made an appeal to the Indians to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan. In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, \"Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates.\" The embassy's warning came in light of clashes between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. Clashes were reported between rival factions of armed forces in Sudan, and several gunshots and explosions were witnessed on Saturday morning in various parts of Khartoum, reported New York Times. As the clashes escalated, later in the day, the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have gained control of the Presidential Palace. Many videos were circulated on social media showing armed fighters driving across the runway of the city's international airport, in which heavy gunshots were audible. The Sudanese military, after 18 months of its coup, had promised to cede control to a civilian-led government this month. Yet, the process has been dominated by a rivalry between General al-Burhan and General Hamdan, also known as Hemeti. (ANI)\n",

            "2023-04-15 In a clash between a paramilitary group with the Sudanese army on Saturday, 25 people lost their lives whereas 183 were severely injured, CNN reported citing the Sudanese Central Medical Committee. The casualties are likely to rise in the clashes that took place near the capital of Khartoum. Meanwhile, Fedail Hospital in central Khartoum has received dozens of wounded civilians and military personnel in the last several hours, reported CNN citing sources. Some of those injured are in critical condition. In a statement earlier, the Sudanese Doctors' Trade Union reported at least three civilian deaths, with two being killed at Khartoum International Airport, according to the union's report, which was released on Saturday, as per CNN. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres has condemned the outbreak of fighting between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces in Sudan. \"The Secretary-General calls on the leaders of the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces to immediately cease hostilities, restore calm and initiate a dialogue to resolve the current crisis. Any further escalation in the fighting will have a devastating impact on civilians and further aggravate the already precarious humanitarian situation in the country,\" the spokesperson for the Secretary-General said. The Indian embassy has also made an appeal to the Indians to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan. In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, \"Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates.\" The embassy's warning came in light of clashes between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. Clashes were reported between rival factions of armed forces in Sudan, and several gunshots and explosions were witnessed on Saturday morning in various parts of Khartoum, reported New York Times. As the clashes escalated, later in the day, the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have gained control of the Presidential Palace. Many videos were circulated on social media showing armed fighters driving across the runway of the city's international airport, in which heavy gunshots were audible.

            "2023-04-15 In a clash between a paramilitary group with the Sudanese army on Saturday, 25 people lost their lives whereas 183 were severely injured, CNN reported citing the Sudanese Central Medical Committee. The casualties are likely to rise in the clashes that took place near the capital of Khartoum. Meanwhile, Fedail Hospital in central Khartoum has received dozens of wounded civilians and military personnel in the last several hours, reported CNN citing sources. Some of those injured are in critical condition. In a statement earlier, the Sudanese Doctors' Trade Union reported at least three civilian deaths, with two being killed at Khartoum International Airport, according to the union's report, which was released on Saturday, as per CNN. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres has condemned the outbreak of fighting between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces in Sudan. \"The Secretary-General calls on the leaders of the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces to immediately cease hostilities, restore calm and initiate a dialogue to resolve the current crisis. Any further escalation in the fighting will have a devastating impact on civilians and further aggravate the already precarious humanitarian situation in the country,\" the spokesperson for the Secretary-General said. The Indian embassy has also made an appeal to the Indians to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan. In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, \"Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates.\" The embassy's warning came in light of clashes between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. Clashes were reported between rival factions of armed forces in Sudan, and several gunshots and explosions were witnessed on Saturday morning in various parts of Khartoum, reported New York Times. As the clashes escalated, later in the day, the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have gained control of the Presidential Palace. Many videos were circulated on social media showing armed fighters driving across the runway of the city's international airport, in which heavy gunshots were audible. The Sudanese military, after 18 months of its coup, had promised to cede control to a civilian-led government this month.

Now it\\u2019s a secret Chinese police station with \\u201csinister\\u201d intentions. On Monday, the FBI unveiled three cases targeting alleged Chinese spy and intimidation efforts in the United States. The first involves the arrest of two men accused of operating an \\u201cillegal overseas police station\\u201d in Manhattan\\u2019s Chinatown on behalf of the Chinese government. Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, both U.S. citizens, were charged with using the facility to track and intimidate Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States. (The station itself, part of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, closed last fall after individuals working there learned of the FBI\\u2019s investigation of the premises.)\\n\\nThe second case accuses 34 Chinese national police officers of working to silence dissidents in the United States. All 34 individuals are believed to be currently living in China, and none of them have been apprehended yet. According to the U.S. Justice Department, the accused are part of the 912 Special Project Working Group, which aims to positively influence public perception of China by having members pose as Americans on social media and post pro-Chinese Communist Party information. A few of the individuals were also accused of issuing death threats against Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States.\\n\\nFinally, the third case builds on a December 2020 criminal complaint alleging that a China-based Zoom employee worked with the Ministry of Public Security to spy on Zoom meetings on topics China considers sensitive, including meetings commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\\n\\nBeijing has rejected the Justice Department\\u2019s claims, calling the FBI\\u2019s investigation \\u201cpolitical manipulation\\u201d and a \\u201cslander and smear campaign.\\u201d These arrests and unsealed cases are just the latest in a series of federal prosecutions focused on stopping Chinese intimidation tactics in recent years. \\u201cThis is a blatant violation of our national sovereignty,\\u201d said Michael Driscoll, who leads the FBI\\u2019s New York field office.\\n\\nHowever, China has been waging a spy war for decades, one Washington failed to recognize before it was too late, historian Calder Walton argues in Foreign Policy. And arrests like these may not be enough to stem the tide. \\u201cRelax,\\u201d Walton writes, \\u201cit\\u2019s much worse than you think.\\u201d\\n\\nToday\\u2019s Most Read\\n\\n\\u2022 The West Is Preparing for Russia\\u2019s Disintegration by Anchal Vohra\\n\\n\\u2022 Macron Said Out Loud What Europeans Really Think About China by Benjamin Haddad\\n\\n\\u2022 What if Kemal Kilicdaroglu Wins Turkey\\u2019s Election? by Steven A. Cook\\n\\nWhat We\\u2019re Following\\n\\nKhartoum cease-fire. Sudanese civilians are hoping for a brief moment of respite. On Tuesday, the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces agreed to a 24-hour cease-fire after four days of heavy fighting and more than 180 deaths. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Gens. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemeti) separately to negotiate the reprieve. Millions of people in the capital have been left hiding in their homes while artillery and airstrikes target residential neighborhoods.\\n\\nCivilians aren\\u2019t the only ones caught in the crossfire. Fighters reportedly attacked a U.S. Embassy convoy as well as assaulted the European Union\\u2019s ambassador to Sudan in his home on Monday. It\\u2019s unclear as of now which side was responsible for these attacks.\\n\\nSurprise visitor. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited occupied Ukrainian territory this weekend to hear reports from military commanders. Video of a speech he gave indicates he traveled to the Kherson and Luhansk regions sometime before Orthodox Easter, although the exact date is still unclear. This trip into Ukraine, though rare, is not Putin\\u2019s first. Last month, the Russian leader traveled to Mariupol in a surprise visit. The coastal city was a key battleground and home to a Russian theater bombing that killed at least 300 civilians in March 2022.\\n\\nSaied cracks down. Tunisian officials arrested four opposition leaders on Monday\\u2014including Rached Ghannouchi, the head of the Ennahdha party, a democratic Islamist movement that once dominated Tunisia\\u2019s parliament. Although Tunisia began transitioning to democracy following the 2011 revolution that saw the toppling of longtime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the current president, Kais Saied, has systematically undermined the North African country\\u2019s fledgling democratic institutions since his election in 2019. Saied has a long history of targeting political dissidents as the nation\\u2019s economy has ticked toward implosion.\\n\\nChart of the Week\\n\\nWith Beijing\\u2019s increasingly assertive military actions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, many U.S. government officials and Indo-Pacific experts worry of an impending Chinese invasion of the island. This includes CIA director William Burns, who predicted that China would invade Taiwan by 2027. But not everyone is so convinced. More than 72 percent of international relations scholars at U.S. colleges and universities polled by William & Mary\\u2019s Teaching, Research, and International Policy project do not believe China will use military force against Taiwan in the next year. To dive deeper into what the likelihood of a war over Taiwan is, check out what the experts have to say.\\n\\nOdds and Ends\\n\\nImagine losing an art contest to a robot.

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir urged Sudanese holdout groups Sunday to join the negotiation table to fast-track the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke after leaders from South Sudan and Sudan witnessed the signing of the third amendment of an implementation matrix of the agreement between Sudan's government and opposition groups under the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF).\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Kiir, who is the guarantor of the Sudan peace agreement, said the signed implementation matrix will fast-track the formation of the transitional government of national unity in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"I would like to once again call upon General Abdelaziz Adam El Hilu, the leader of the SPLM-North, and Ustaz Abdul Wahid Mohamed al Nur, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, to seriously consider joining the Juba Peace Agreement,\\\" said Kiir, according to a press statement posted on his official Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stressed that lasting peace in Sudan will remain elusive until these leaders join the peace train.\\n\\n\\n\\nKiir said that peace is an important dividend for the two sisterly countries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As a guarantor, our shared historical values and common interests demand that we work for stability to ensure prosperity for our people. It is our desire for peace in Sudan that compelled us to host numerous rounds of negotiations between the transitional government and various oppositions groups,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said the new roadmap is not an attempt at renegotiating the 2020 Juba peace agreement signed to end decades of conflict but rather to facilitate dialogue among parties to transition the country toward a sustainable peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As the guarantor who led the process, let me reiterate on behalf of other guarantors that this workshop is not a parallel political process or a renegotiation of the Juba Peace Agreement. It is intended to contribute to the ongoing dialogue in Sudan about options for the transition and best approach towards the issue of democratic transformation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opposition parties that signed the matrix include the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) faction led by Malik Agar, the Justice and Equality Movement under Gibril Ibrahim, the Democratic Union party led by Eltom Hajou and the Sudan Liberation Movement under Minni Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe holdout groups such as the SPLM-N faction led by Abdel Aziz Al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement under Abdul Wahi Al-Nur did not sign the matrix.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan's Sovereign Council, said his government remains committed to realizing security, freedom and development in all regions of Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"The implementation of the Juba peace agreement will help in putting into practice the 2012 cooperation agreement, providing joint border security and the opening of border points for trade and exchange,\\\" said Al-Burhan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe reaffirmed his government's commitment to work with the signatories to the Juba peace deal to fully implement the matrix for lasting peace in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinnawi called on the international community and the region to avail financial and political support for the implementation of the peace deal, which has stalled due to a lack of funding and political uncertainty in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"We need political and financial support including regional and international support to bring changes and fully implement all pending tasks. In Darfur, we call for peace and development, and we hope the Juba Peace Agreement will allow refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their original homes,\\\" said Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsmail Wais, the special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), urged the signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement to consistently implement it, noting that the peace guarantors are behind the government of Sudan to ensure that a sustainable peace is reached in the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nEl Sheikh Iben Omar, the special advisor of Chad's President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, commended the government of South Sudan for the support and mediation of the Sudanese peace agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Juba Peace Agreement was signed in Juba under the auspices of President Kiir on Oct. 3, 2020 between the Sudanese government and 14 signatories. The Republic of Chad, United Arab Emirates and IGAD are the guarantors, while Egypt and Qatar are witnesses to the peace deal. -\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News The second example in the world was found in Anatolia: Exactly 1600 years old.\\n\\nIn the excavations conducted at the ancient city of Hadrianopolis, which was used as a settlement during the Late Chalcolithic, Roman, and Early Byzantine periods, a pendant depicting Prophet Solomon, approximately 1600 years old, was uncovered. 6 minutes ago...\\n\\nThe world-famous football player was sentenced to prison for sexual assault while under the influence of alcohol.\\n\\nFrench forward Wissam Ben Yedder, of Tunisian descent, has been sentenced to a two-year suspended prison term for committing sexual assault while under the influence of alcohol.

Now it\\u2019s a secret Chinese police station with \\u201csinister\\u201d intentions. On Monday, the FBI unveiled three cases targeting alleged Chinese spy and intimidation efforts in the United States. The first involves the arrest of two men accused of operating an \\u201cillegal overseas police station\\u201d in Manhattan\\u2019s Chinatown on behalf of the Chinese government. Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, both U.S. citizens, were charged with using the facility to track and intimidate Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States. (The station itself, part of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, closed last fall after individuals working there learned of the FBI\\u2019s investigation of the premises.)\\n\\nThe second case accuses 34 Chinese national police officers of working to silence dissidents in the United States. All 34 individuals are believed to be currently living in China, and none of them have been apprehended yet. According to the U.S. Justice Department, the accused are part of the 912 Special Project Working Group, which aims to positively influence public perception of China by having members pose as Americans on social media and post pro-Chinese Communist Party information. A few of the individuals were also accused of issuing death threats against Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States.\\n\\nFinally, the third case builds on a December 2020 criminal complaint alleging that a China-based Zoom employee worked with the Ministry of Public Security to spy on Zoom meetings on topics China considers sensitive, including meetings commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\\n\\nBeijing has rejected the Justice Department\\u2019s claims, calling the FBI\\u2019s investigation \\u201cpolitical manipulation\\u201d and a \\u201cslander and smear campaign.\\u201d These arrests and unsealed cases are just the latest in a series of federal prosecutions focused on stopping Chinese intimidation tactics in recent years. \\u201cThis is a blatant violation of our national sovereignty,\\u201d said Michael Driscoll, who leads the FBI\\u2019s New York field office.\\n\\nHowever, China has been waging a spy war for decades, one Washington failed to recognize before it was too late, historian Calder Walton argues in Foreign Policy. And arrests like these may not be enough to stem the tide. \\u201cRelax,\\u201d Walton writes, \\u201cit\\u2019s much worse than you think.\\u201d\\n\\nToday\\u2019s Most Read\\n\\n\\u2022 The West Is Preparing for Russia\\u2019s Disintegration by Anchal Vohra\\n\\n\\u2022 Macron Said Out Loud What Europeans Really Think About China by Benjamin Haddad\\n\\n\\u2022 What if Kemal Kilicdaroglu Wins Turkey\\u2019s Election? by Steven A.

On Tuesday, the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces agreed to a 24-hour cease-fire after four days of heavy fighting and more than 180 deaths. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Gens. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemeti) separately to negotiate the reprieve. Millions of people in the capital have been left hiding in their homes while artillery and airstrikes target residential neighborhoods.\\n\\nCivilians aren\\u2019t the only ones caught in the crossfire. Fighters reportedly attacked a U.S. Embassy convoy as well as assaulted the European Union\\u2019s ambassador to Sudan in his home on Monday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited occupied Ukrainian territory this weekend to hear reports from military commanders. Video of a speech he gave indicates he traveled to the Kherson and Luhansk regions sometime before Orthodox Easter, although the exact date is still unclear. This trip into Ukraine, though rare, is not Putin\\u2019s first. Last month, the Russian leader traveled to Mariupol in a surprise visit. The coastal city was a key battleground and home to a Russian theater bombing that killed at least 300 civilians in March 2022.\\n\\nSaied cracks down. Tunisian officials arrested four opposition leaders on Monday\\u2014including Rached Ghannouchi, the head of the Ennahdha party, a democratic Islamist movement that once dominated Tunisia\\u2019s parliament. Although Tunisia began transitioning to democracy following the 2011 revolution that saw the toppling of longtime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the current president, Kais Saied, has systematically undermined the North African country\\u2019s fledgling democratic institutions since his election in 2019.

This includes CIA director William Burns, who predicted that China would invade Taiwan by 2027. But not everyone is so convinced. More than 72 percent of international relations scholars at U.S. colleges and universities polled by William & Mary\\u2019s Teaching, Research, and International Policy project do not believe China will use military force against Taiwan in the next year.

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir urged Sudanese holdout groups Sunday to join the negotiation table to fast-track the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke after leaders from South Sudan and Sudan witnessed the signing of the third amendment of an implementation matrix of the agreement between Sudan's government and opposition groups under the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF).\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Kiir, who is the guarantor of the Sudan peace agreement, said the signed implementation matrix will fast-track the formation of the transitional government of national unity in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"I would like to once again call upon General Abdelaziz Adam El Hilu, the leader of the SPLM-North, and Ustaz Abdul Wahid Mohamed al Nur, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, to seriously consider joining the Juba Peace Agreement,\\\" said Kiir, according to a press statement posted on his official Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stressed that lasting peace in Sudan will remain elusive until these leaders join the peace train.\\n\\n\\n\\nKiir said that peace is an important dividend for the two sisterly countries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As a guarantor, our shared historical values and common interests demand that we work for stability to ensure prosperity for our people. It is our desire for peace in Sudan that compelled us to host numerous rounds of negotiations between the transitional government and various oppositions groups,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said the new roadmap is not an attempt at renegotiating the 2020 Juba peace agreement signed to end decades of conflict but rather to facilitate dialogue among parties to transition the country toward a sustainable peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As the guarantor who led the process, let me reiterate on behalf of other guarantors that this workshop is not a parallel political process or a renegotiation of the Juba Peace Agreement. It is intended to contribute to the ongoing dialogue in Sudan about options for the transition and best approach towards the issue of democratic transformation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opposition parties that signed the matrix include the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) faction led by Malik Agar, the Justice and Equality Movement under Gibril Ibrahim, the Democratic Union party led by Eltom Hajou and the Sudan Liberation Movement under Minni Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe holdout groups such as the SPLM-N faction led by Abdel Aziz Al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement under Abdul Wahi Al-Nur did not sign the matrix.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan's Sovereign Council, said his government remains committed to realizing security, freedom and development in all regions of Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"The implementation of the Juba peace agreement will help in putting into practice the 2012 cooperation agreement, providing joint border security and the opening of border points for trade and exchange,\\\" said Al-Burhan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe reaffirmed his government's commitment to work with the signatories to the Juba peace deal to fully implement the matrix for lasting peace in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinnawi called on the international community and the region to avail financial and political support for the implementation of the peace deal, which has stalled due to a lack of funding and political uncertainty in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"We need political and financial support including regional and international support to bring changes and fully implement all pending tasks. In Darfur, we call for peace and development, and we hope the Juba Peace Agreement will allow refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their original homes,\\\" said Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsmail Wais, the special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), urged the signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement to consistently implement it, noting that the peace guarantors are behind the government of Sudan to ensure that a sustainable peace is reached in the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nEl Sheikh Iben Omar, the special advisor of Chad's President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, commended the government of South Sudan for the support and mediation of the Sudanese peace agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Juba Peace Agreement was signed in Juba under the auspices of President Kiir on Oct. 3, 2020 between the Sudanese government and 14 signatories.

Now it\\u2019s a secret Chinese police station with \\u201csinister\\u201d intentions. On Monday, the FBI unveiled three cases targeting alleged Chinese spy and intimidation efforts in the United States. The first involves the arrest of two men accused of operating an \\u201cillegal overseas police station\\u201d in Manhattan\\u2019s Chinatown on behalf of the Chinese government. Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, both U.S. citizens, were charged with using the facility to track and intimidate Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States. (The station itself, part of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, closed last fall after individuals working there learned of the FBI\\u2019s investigation of the premises.)\\n\\nThe second case accuses 34 Chinese national police officers of working to silence dissidents in the United States. All 34 individuals are believed to be currently living in China, and none of them have been apprehended yet. According to the U.S. Justice Department, the accused are part of the 912 Special Project Working Group, which aims to positively influence public perception of China by having members pose as Americans on social media and post pro-Chinese Communist Party information. A few of the individuals were also accused of issuing death threats against Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists in the United States.\\n\\nFinally, the third case builds on a December 2020 criminal complaint alleging that a China-based Zoom employee worked with the Ministry of Public Security to spy on Zoom meetings on topics China considers sensitive, including meetings commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\\n\\nBeijing has rejected the Justice Department\\u2019s claims, calling the FBI\\u2019s investigation \\u201cpolitical manipulation\\u201d and a \\u201cslander and smear campaign.\\u201d These arrests and unsealed cases are just the latest in a series of federal prosecutions focused on stopping Chinese intimidation tactics in recent years. \\u201cThis is a blatant violation of our national sovereignty,\\u201d said Michael Driscoll, who leads the FBI\\u2019s New York field office.\\n\\nHowever, China has been waging a spy war for decades, one Washington failed to recognize before it was too late, historian Calder Walton argues in Foreign Policy. And arrests like these may not be enough to stem the tide. \\u201cRelax,\\u201d Walton writes, \\u201cit\\u2019s much worse than you think.\\u201d\\n\\nToday\\u2019s Most Read\\n\\n\\u2022 The West Is Preparing for Russia\\u2019s Disintegration by Anchal Vohra\\n\\n\\u2022 Macron Said Out Loud What Europeans Really Think About China by Benjamin Haddad\\n\\n\\u2022 What if Kemal Kilicdaroglu Wins Turkey\\u2019s Election? by Steven A. Cook\\n\\nWhat We\\u2019re Following\\n\\nKhartoum cease-fire. Sudanese civilians are hoping for a brief moment of respite. On Tuesday, the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces agreed to a 24-hour cease-fire after four days of heavy fighting and more than 180 deaths. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Gens. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemeti) separately to negotiate the reprieve. Millions of people in the capital have been left hiding in their homes while artillery and airstrikes target residential neighborhoods.\\n\\nCivilians aren\\u2019t the only ones caught in the crossfire. Fighters reportedly attacked a U.S. Embassy convoy as well as assaulted the European Union\\u2019s ambassador to Sudan in his home on Monday. It\\u2019s unclear as of now which side was responsible for these attacks.\\n\\nSurprise visitor. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited occupied Ukrainian territory this weekend to hear reports from military commanders. Video of a speech he gave indicates he traveled to the Kherson and Luhansk regions sometime before Orthodox Easter, although the exact date is still unclear. This trip into Ukraine, though rare, is not Putin\\u2019s first. Last month, the Russian leader traveled to Mariupol in a surprise visit. The coastal city was a key battleground and home to a Russian theater bombing that killed at least 300 civilians in March 2022.\\n\\nSaied cracks down. Tunisian officials arrested four opposition leaders on Monday\\u2014including Rached Ghannouchi, the head of the Ennahdha party, a democratic Islamist movement that once dominated Tunisia\\u2019s parliament. Although Tunisia began transitioning to democracy following the 2011 revolution that saw the toppling of longtime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the current president, Kais Saied, has systematically undermined the North African country\\u2019s fledgling democratic institutions since his election in 2019. Saied has a long history of targeting political dissidents as the nation\\u2019s economy has ticked toward implosion.\\n\\nChart of the Week\\n\\nWith Beijing\\u2019s increasingly assertive military actions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, many U.S. government officials and Indo-Pacific experts worry of an impending Chinese invasion of the island. This includes CIA director William Burns, who predicted that China would invade Taiwan by 2027. But not everyone is so convinced. More than 72 percent of international relations scholars at U.S. colleges and universities polled by William & Mary\\u2019s Teaching, Research, and International Policy project do not believe China will use military force against Taiwan in the next year. To dive deeper into what the likelihood of a war over Taiwan is, check out what the experts have to say.\\n\\nOdds and Ends\\n\\nImagine losing an art contest to a robot. For contestants in the creative open category of the 2023 Sony World Photography Awards, they don\\u2019t need to imagine it.

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir urged Sudanese holdout groups Sunday to join the negotiation table to fast-track the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke after leaders from South Sudan and Sudan witnessed the signing of the third amendment of an implementation matrix of the agreement between Sudan's government and opposition groups under the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF).\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Kiir, who is the guarantor of the Sudan peace agreement, said the signed implementation matrix will fast-track the formation of the transitional government of national unity in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"I would like to once again call upon General Abdelaziz Adam El Hilu, the leader of the SPLM-North, and Ustaz Abdul Wahid Mohamed al Nur, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, to seriously consider joining the Juba Peace Agreement,\\\" said Kiir, according to a press statement posted on his official Facebook page.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stressed that lasting peace in Sudan will remain elusive until these leaders join the peace train.\\n\\n\\n\\nKiir said that peace is an important dividend for the two sisterly countries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As a guarantor, our shared historical values and common interests demand that we work for stability to ensure prosperity for our people. It is our desire for peace in Sudan that compelled us to host numerous rounds of negotiations between the transitional government and various oppositions groups,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said the new roadmap is not an attempt at renegotiating the 2020 Juba peace agreement signed to end decades of conflict but rather to facilitate dialogue among parties to transition the country toward a sustainable peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"As the guarantor who led the process, let me reiterate on behalf of other guarantors that this workshop is not a parallel political process or a renegotiation of the Juba Peace Agreement. It is intended to contribute to the ongoing dialogue in Sudan about options for the transition and best approach towards the issue of democratic transformation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opposition parties that signed the matrix include the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) faction led by Malik Agar, the Justice and Equality Movement under Gibril Ibrahim, the Democratic Union party led by Eltom Hajou and the Sudan Liberation Movement under Minni Minnawi.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe holdout groups such as the SPLM-N faction led by Abdel Aziz Al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement under Abdul Wahi Al-Nur did not sign the matrix.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan's Sovereign Council, said his government remains committed to realizing security, freedom and development in all regions of Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"The implementation of the Juba peace agreement will help in putting into practice the 2012 cooperation agreement, providing joint border security and the opening of border points for trade and exchange,\\\" said Al-Burhan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe reaffirmed his government's commitment to work with the signatories to the Juba peace deal to fully implement the matrix for lasting peace in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinnawi called on the international community and the region to avail financial and political support for the implementation of the peace deal, which has stalled due to a lack of funding and political uncertainty in Sudan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"We need political and financial support including regional and international support to bring changes and fully implement all pending tasks.

            "In the midst of this impasse involving the forces loyal to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his nemesis the militia leader General Mohamed Hamdan Degalo, the African Union (AU) held a meeting on June 1 aimed at restarting its process for stabilizing Sudan. The AU position provides a far more comprehensive roadmap not only to end the current security crisis, but the plan calls for the reimposition of an elected government.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nevertheless, even during the April-May ceasefire periods, fighting continued in the capital of Khartoum where the RSF has reportedly taken over residential districts and public facilities. SAF fighter jets are carrying out aerial bombardments of areas inside the capital and its environs in attempts to flush out RSF units from the city.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since April 15 when the fighting erupted, hundreds of people have been reportedly killed with thousands wounded. Approximately 2 million civilians both Sudanese nationals and refugees from neighboring states, are displaced within and outside the Republic of Sudan. The refugees initially fled from instability in South Sudan, Ethiopia and other countries.\n",
            "\n",
            "The humanitarian situation has reached critical proportions with the closure of most of the hospitals in Khartoum along with schools, businesses and diplomatic missions. Transportation hubs with buses and taxis are taking people away from the centers of the fighting in the capital and its twin city of Omdurman at great risk. With the failure of the Jeddah talks during early June, the AU and the other regional organizations in East Africa will inevitably become more aggressive in advancing their stabilization programs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Underlying the failed talks in Jeddah are the factors related to the interference by the United States and Saudi Arabia in the internal affairs of the Republic of Sudan. In recent years since the removal of former President Omar Hassan al-Bashir by his military cohorts in efforts to halt a popular revolutionary movement from taking power in 2019, the U.S. State Department and the Saudi government rushed in to legitimize the military through financial assistance and promises of conditional large-scale loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "These U.S.-Saudi led efforts to reshape the political construct in Sudan during the last four years sought to overshadow the will of a substantial majority of the people inside the country. The military leadership began negotiations with the armed opposition groupings operating in Darfur and the border areas in the South. By October 2021, when the two military structures of the SAF and RSF overthrew the already fragile Sovereign Council headed by then interim Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, many of the armed opposition forces which had signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in Juba–capital of the Republic of South Sudan–sided with the Transitional Military Council which staged the coup.\n",

            "The Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), the Sudanese Professional Association (SPA), and other mass organizations, political parties and trade unions were disregarded in the process engineered by the U.S. The SAF has openly criticized the United Nations envoy to Sudan, Volker Perthes, saying that he is no longer welcome. Despite these difficulties, both sides in the current conflict will be compelled to reach an agreement since they cannot continue the fighting without external assistance.\n",

A June 1 meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at the headquarters of the AU represented the third meeting of an Expanded Mechanism seeking an end to the conflict and the beginning of a democratic transition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Britain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had established what is known as the “Quad.” Neither of these formations, the trilateral mechanism or the Quad, have been able to establish a firm ceasefire and a way forward in stabilizing the country under a democratic government.\n",

            "“The Expanded Mechanism expressed concern at the continued fighting and stressed that there is no military solution to the conflict. The importance of a coordinated approach to resolving the crisis and the need for an African-led Sudanese-owned process was underlined. The participants cautioned against the proliferation of uncoordinated initiatives that would undermine the collective effort and the sovereignty of Sudan.\n",

            "The Expanded Mechanism welcomed the Jeddah Process facilitated by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States of America, which resulted in the Declaration of Commitments and the Short-term Ceasefire and Humanitarian Arrangement and welcomed the five-day extension of the ceasefire announced on 29 May 2023. The Mechanism expressed concern at the lack of full implementation of the humanitarian ceasefire and the deteriorating humanitarian situation. In this regard, the Expanded Mechanism urged the parties to fully commit to undertaking their obligations to protect civilians and civil infrastructure and ensure the delivery of unhindered humanitarian assistance.” (https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20230601/third-meeting-expanded-mechanism-resolution-sudan-conflict)\n",
